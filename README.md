# opencv-ares

## Introduction
Hello my name is *Samyak Uttam*!

## My strategy to implement these concepts
First of all I tried to use opencv in codeblocks, but I couldn't get any useful links for using the latest version of opencv in it. So finally I tried to use it with visual studio and it worked. Now to implement these concepts I googled these topics and gone for the Official Opencv tutorials and understand the topics form there and then written the code myself in visual studio taking help from tutorials.

## What I learnt in the process 
In this process I learnt about an open source computer vision and machine learning software library, **opencv**, through which we can do some real cool stuff. I have implemented some concepts of *Image Processing* and *Computer Vision* through it. I got to learn about the functions of it, and how there is mathematics behind all these functions.
